  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I enjoy finance, data and numbers.</strong> My passion is helping people. But, when I'm not analyzing a financial statement, benchmarking KPIs or fine-tuning a machine learning model, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My new area of focus</strong> is applying data science to business and financial planning. 
    I strive to create value for companies by understanding the financials and using data to deliver solutions. 
    I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
